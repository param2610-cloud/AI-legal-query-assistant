For locality-based court recommendations and property valuation features, you need to train your system on these critical data categories:

## **1. Geographic Jurisdiction Mapping** (Most Critical)

You need comprehensive mapping data like:
- **Pincode → Court jurisdiction** mapping for every area
- **Property location → Registration office** assignments  
- **Case value → Appropriate court level** rules
- **Distance and accessibility** data for court recommendations

Example: `Gurgaon Sector 14 → District Court Gurgaon + Sub-Registrar Sector 17`

## **2. Property Valuation Data** (For Registration Recommendations)

Essential data includes:
- **Circle rates by location** (updated quarterly)
- **Market rates vs. government rates** comparison
- **Stamp duty variations** by state/gender/property type
- **Registration fee structures** and calculation methods

## **3. Court Hierarchy and Pecuniary Jurisdiction**

Your system needs to know:
- **Civil court pecuniary limits** (Junior Civil Judge: up to ₹3 lakh, Senior: up to ₹20 lakh)
- **Consumer forum value thresholds** (District: up to ₹20 lakh, State: up to ₹1 crore)
- **Criminal court jurisdiction** by offense severity
- **Specialized court mappings** (Family Court, MACT, etc.)

## **4. Real-Time Court Infrastructure Data**

Collect and maintain:
- **Court addresses and contact details**
- **Working hours and holiday schedules**  
- **Digital filing capabilities** and e-payment options
- **Current case load and disposal rates**
- **Judge specializations** and performance metrics

## **5. Local Legal Procedure Variations**

State-specific data like:
- **Haryana-specific registration requirements** (HUDA clearances, etc.)
- **Local court rules and procedures**
- **Regional fee structures** and additional charges
- **Language preferences** and interpreter availability

## **6. Historical Performance Analytics**

Train on:
- **Case disposal timeframes** by court and case type
- **Success rates** for different legal issues
- **Seasonal variations** in court functioning
- **Judge-wise performance patterns**

## **7. Integration APIs and Live Data**

Connect to:
- **e-Courts API** for real-time case status
- **Registration Department APIs** for current circle rates
- **Revenue Record APIs** for property verification
- **Consumer Forum portals** for complaint tracking

## **Machine Learning Training Requirements:**

### **Court Recommendation Model**
```python
training_features = [
    'case_type', 'dispute_value', 'user_pincode', 
    'property_location', 'urgency_level', 'language_preference'
]
target = 'optimal_court_with_reasoning'
```

### **Property Valuation Model**  
```python
training_features = [
    'coordinates', 'property_type', 'size_sqft', 
    'age', 'amenities', 'market_trends'
]
target = 'estimated_registration_value'
```

### **Case Duration Prediction Model**
```python
training_features = [
    'court_id', 'case_type', 'judge_id', 
    'complexity_score', 'historical_patterns'
]
target = 'expected_disposal_months'
```

## **Key Implementation Priority:**

1. **Start with major cities** (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai)
2. **Focus on common case types** (consumer complaints, property disputes)
3. **Build jurisdiction mapping** before complex analytics
4. **Integrate government APIs** for real-time data
5. **Add ML recommendations** after basic rule-based system works

The system should ultimately provide responses like: *"For your ₹50 lakh property dispute in Gurgaon Sector 14, file in Senior Civil Judge Court, Gurgaon. Registration should be done at Sub-Registrar Sector 17. Expected stamp duty: ₹3 lakh. Estimated case duration: 16 months."*

Would you like me to detail the data collection process for any specific geographic region or court system?
