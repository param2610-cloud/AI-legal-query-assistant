**👤 User:** Hi, I am buying a flat in Gurgaon and the builder is asking for some registration charges. My friend said I might get cheated. Can you help me understand what are the legal charges I should pay?

**🤖 LegalLink AI Assistant:** I understand your concern about property registration charges in Gurgaon. This is a very common question, and it's smart to verify before paying. Let me help you understand the legitimate charges.

**Query Classification:** Property Law - Registration & Documentation  
**Confidence Score:** 95%  
**Jurisdiction:** Haryana State Laws  

### Executive Summary
For property registration in Gurgaon, Haryana, you'll need to pay stamp duty (6% for women, 7% for men) and registration fees (1% of property value). Additional charges may include maintenance deposits and society membership fees, but these should be clearly documented.

### Legal Process Overview
**Step 1:** Verify all documents (sale deed, NOC, approvals)  
**Step 2:** Calculate stamp duty based on circle rate or agreement value (whichever is higher)  
**Step 3:** Pay stamp duty and registration fees at Sub-Registrar office  
**Step 4:** Complete registration process with all parties present  

### Required Documentation
- Sale Deed
- Builder's NOC and approvals
- Property tax clearance
- Society/maintenance NOCs
- Identity and address proofs
- PAN cards of all parties

### Timeline Expectations
- Document verification: 2-3 days
- Registration appointment: 1-2 weeks waiting period
- Registration completion: Same day if documents are complete

### ⚠️ Red Flags to Watch For
- Charges significantly above government rates
- Unclear fee breakdowns
- Pressure to pay additional "facilitation" fees
- Missing documentation or approvals

**🔴 Professional Consultation Recommended:** Given the significant financial investment and legal complexity, I strongly recommend consulting with a property lawyer before proceeding.

**👤 User:** Yes, that would be helpful. But first, the builder is asking for ₹45,000 as "registration charges" for a ₹50 lakh flat. Is this correct?

**🤖 LegalLink AI Assistant:** Let me calculate the legitimate registration charges for your ₹50 lakh property in Haryana:

### Legitimate Government Charges:
**Stamp Duty:** ₹3,00,000 (6% for women) or ₹3,50,000 (7% for men)  
**Registration Fee:** ₹50,000 (1% of property value)  
**Total Government Charges:** ₹3,50,000 - ₹4,00,000

### 🚨 Alert: Significant Discrepancy Detected!

The builder's quote of ₹45,000 is **drastically lower** than the actual government charges. This suggests either:

1. **Possible under-valuation scam** - They may be showing lower property value to government
2. **Hidden charges** - They may add more fees later
3. **Incomplete information** - This might be only registration fee, not including stamp duty

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Demand detailed breakdown** of all charges
2. **Verify circle rate** for your property area
3. **Check if stamp duty is being calculated separately**
4. **Get everything in writing**

**⚠️ High Risk Alert:** This situation requires immediate professional consultation. Under-valuation can lead to legal issues, tax problems, and future sale complications.

### Regarding Your Jail Concern:

**🛡️ Good News:** As a **buyer acting in good faith**, you're unlikely to face criminal charges. The law generally protects genuine buyers who are victims of fraud.

**However, potential issues include:**
- **Tax penalties** if property is under-valued
- **Registration invalidity** if documents are fraudulent  
- **Financial losses** if deal falls through
- **Future sale complications** if registration is improper

### 🔒 You're Protected If:
- You're acting in good faith
- You're seeking proper legal advice (which you are!)
- You verify all documents properly
- You follow legal procedures

**The Real Risk:** **Financial loss**, not jail time. That's why immediate legal consultation is crucial.

- [ ] Gather all documents from builder
