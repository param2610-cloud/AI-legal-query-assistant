## Summary

âœ… **Your CaseLawAnalyzer is working correctly!** 

The test shows that:
- âœ… CaseLawAnalyzer initialized successfully without metadata errors
- âœ… 38 case law documents loaded and indexed
- âœ… Vector database created successfully
- âœ… Indian Kanoon API client initialized

The error at the end is just a **Windows-specific cleanup issue** with temporary directories, not a problem with your code functionality.

## What the Error Means

The `PermissionError` happens because:
1. ChromaDB keeps SQLite database files open on Windows
2. Python's `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` tries to delete files that are still in use
3. This is a known Windows limitation, not a bug in your code

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use the Simple Test Script (Recommended)
```bash
python test_case_law_simple.py
```

This avoids the temporary directory issue by using a persistent test directory.

### Option 2: Install Updated ChromaDB
```bash
pip install --upgrade chromadb langchain-chroma
```

### Option 3: Use Persistent Directory in Production
Always use a persistent directory for your vector database:
```python
analyzer = CaseLawAnalyzer(
    case_law_dir='training_data/case_law', 
    vector_db_path='chroma_db_caselaw'  # Persistent directory
)
```
