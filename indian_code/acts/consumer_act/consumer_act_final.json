      "full_text": "The moment a person comes into this would, he starts consum­ing. He needs clothes, milk, oil, soap, water, and many more things and these needs keep taking one form or the other all along his life. Thus we all are consumers in the literal sense of the term. When we approach the market as a consumer, we expect value for money,i.e.,right quality, right quantity, right prices, information about the mode of use, etc. But there may be instances where a consumer is harassed or cheated. The Government understood the need to protect consumers from unscrupulous suppliers, and several laws have been made for this purpose. We have the Indian Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Dangerous Drugs Act, the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, the Indian Standards Institution (Certification Marks) Act, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, the Stand­ards of Weights and Measures Act, etc. which to some extent protect consumer interests. However, these laws require the con­sumer to initiate action by way of a civil suit involving lengthy legal process which is very expensive and time consuming. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was enacted to provide a sim­pler and quicker access to redressal of consumer grievances. The Act for the first time introduced the concept of ‘consumer’ and conferred express additional rights on him. It is interesting to note that the Act doesn’t seek to protect every consumer within the literal meaning of the term. The protection is meant for the person who fits in the definition of ‘consumer’ given by the Act. Now we understand that the Consumer Protection Act provides means to protect consumers from getting cheated or harassed by suppli­ers. The question arises how a consumer will seek protection ? The answer is the Act has provided a machinery whereby consumers can file their complaints which will be entertained by the Con­sumer Forums with special powers so that action can be taken against erring suppliers and the possible compensation may be awarded to consumer for the hardships he has undergone. No court fee is required to be paid to these forums and there is no need to engage a lawyer to present the case. Following chapter entails a discussion on who is a consumer under the Act, what are the things which can be complained against, when and by whom a complaint can be made and what are the relief available to consumers.",

The words “....with the approval of the buyer” in the definition denotes that the user of the goods should be a rightful user. Example: A purchased a scooter which was in B’s possession from the date of purchase. B was using it and taking it to the seller for repairs and service from time to time. Later on B had a complaint regarding the scooter. He sued the seller. The seller pleaded that since B did not buy the scooter, he was not a con­sumer under the Act. The Delhi State Commission held that B, the complainant was using it with the approval of A, the buyer, and therefore he was consumer under the Act.

      "full_text": "within which a complaint can be filed - Section 24A of the Act provides that a consumer dispute can be filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action arises. Since this provision was inserted in the Act in 1993, before that the Consumer Forums were following the Limitation Act, 1963, which says that a suit can be filed within three years after the cause of action arises. The point of time when cause of action arises is an important factor in determining the time period available to file a com­plaint. There are no set rules to decide such time. It depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Examples : 1. A got his eye operated by B in 1989. He got a certifi­cate of blindness on 18th December, 1989. He was still in hope of gaining his sight and went from second operation in 1992 and was discharged on 21-1-1992. He filed a complaint against B on 11-1-1994. B opposed on the ground that more than 2 years were over after 18-12-1989, thus the complaint is not maintainable. The Commission held that here the cause of action for filing the complaint would arose after the second operation when A lost entire hope of recovery. Thus the suit is maintainable - Mukund Lal Ganguly v. Dr. Abhijit Ghosh III 1995 CPJ 64. 2. A house was allotted on 1-1-1999. Defects appeared in the house on 10-1-1999. Here the cause of action will arise on 10-1-1999. It may be noted that these time frames are not absolute limita­tions. If the Consumer Forum is satisfied that there was suffi­cient cause for not filing the complaint within the prescribed period, it can entertain a complaint beyond limitation time. However the Forum must record the reasons for condonation of delay. Example : A deposited some jewellery with a bank. Bank lost it. Bank kept giving her false sense of hope to retrieve the jewel­lery, and thus A was put in a state of inaction. Later on when A filed a suit on the Bank, it claimed that the suit was not main­tainable as the limitation time after the cause of action arose has lapsed.

      "full_text": "Restrictive Trade Practice - Section 2(1)(nn) of the Act provides that, “restrictive trade practice” means “any trade practice which requires a consumer to buy, hire or avail of any goods or, as the case may be, services as a condition prece­dent for buying, hiring or availing of other goods or services”. An analysis of above definition reveals that where sale or pur­chase of a product or service is made conditional on the sale or purchase of one or more other products and services, it amounts to restrictive trade practice. Technically, this type of arrangement is called ‘tie-up sales’ or ‘tying arrangement’. The effect of such an arrangement is that a purchaser is forced to buy some goods or services which he may not require alongwith the goods or services which he wants to buy. Thus where a buyer agrees to purchase product ‘X’ upon a condition that he will also purchase product ‘Y’ from the seller, the sale of product ‘Y’ (tied product) is tied to the sale of product ‘X’ (tying product). The buyer has to forego his free choice between competing products. This results in neutralizing healthy competition in the ‘tied’ market. Example : A, a gas distributor instead his customers to buy gas stove as a condition to give gas connection. It was held that it was a restrictive trade practice - Re. Anand Gas RTPE 43/1983 (MRTPC). However, where there is no such precondition and the buyer is free to take either product, no tying arrangement could be alleged even though the seller may offer both the products as a single unit at a composite price. Example : A is a furniture dealer. He is selling Sofa at Rs. 20,000 and Bed at Rs. 15,000. He has an offer that whoever will buy Sofa and Bed both, he will charge Rs. 30,000 only. Here the choice is open to the customer to buy the products single or composite. This is not a restrictive trade practice. Note : The term ‘restrictive trade practice’ has a very wide meaning when read in context of the MRTP Act, 1969. However under Consumer Protection Act, 1986, it has been used in a narrower sense.

The definition provides a list of eleven sectors to which service may pertain in order to come under the purview of the Act. The list of these sectors is not an exhaustive one. Service may be of any description and pertain to any sector if it satisfy the following criteria: 1. service is made available to the potential users, i.e., service not only to the actual users but also to those who are capable of using it. 2. it should not be free of charge, e.g., the medical service rendered free of charge in Government hospital is not a service under the Act; 3. it should not be under a contract of personal service. When we talk about ‘service’ under the Consumer Protection Act, we take it as a regular commercial transaction. Thus the services rendered under the contract of personal service are specifically excluded from the definition. The expression ‘contract of personal service’ is not defined under the Act. In common parlance, it means - a contract to render service in a private capacity to an individual. For example, where a servant enters into an agreement with a master for em­ployment, or where a landlord agrees to supply water to his tenant, these are the contracts of personal service. The idea is that under a personal service relationship, a person can discon­tinue the service at any time according to his will, he need not approach Consumer Forum to complaint about deficiency in service.

The rationale behind this provision is to ensure physical safety of the consumers. The law seeks to ensure that those responsible for bringing goods to the market, in particular, suppliers, exporters, importers, retailers and the like should ensure that while in their care these goods are not rendered unsafe through improper handling or storage. Consumers should be instructed in the proper use of goods and should be informed of the risks involved in intended or normally foreseeable use. Vital safety information should be conveyed to consumers. Example :A bought an insecticide from B. B did not inform A that touching this insecticide with bare hands can create skin prob­lem.

Thus the Act has detailed some rights of consumers which need to be protected by the councils. These are : Right to safety - It is right to be protected against the marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and property. Unsafe goods may cause death or serious injury to the user due to defective ingredients, defective design, poor workmanship, or any other reason. At times safety hazards are found due to absence of proper instructions to use the product. Thus it is to be ensured that— Manufacturers and traders ensure that the goods are safe for the users, in case of hazardous goods, they give clear instructions as to mode of use, consumer is informed of the risk involved in improper use of goods, vital safety information is conveyed to consumers. Manufacturers or distributors who become aware of the unforeseen hazards after the goods are supplied must inform the authorities and the public in order to forewarn consumers about such hazards. Where a product is found such as is likely to be hazardous even when properly used, traders should either recall it and modify the same, or replace it with a new product, or adequately compen­sate for it.

When goods are bought to resell or commercially exploit them, such buyer or user is not a consumer under the Act. Examples : 1. A jeep was purchased to run it as a taxi. The question was whether the buyer of the jeep was a consumer under the Act. The Rajasthan State Commission held that to use the jeep as a taxi with the object to earn profits was a commercial purpose, and therefore, the buyer/user was not a consumer within the meaning of the Act.

The computer system was giving constant trouble and Z was not attending it properly. L Ltd. filed a complaint against Z with the National Commission. Z contended that L Ltd. was not a consumer under the Act because computer system was used for commercial purposes. L Ltd. argued that computer system was not directly used of commer­cial purposes rather it was used to facilitate the work of the company. The Commission rejected the argument on the grounds that the system made part of the assets of the company, and its ex­penses were met by it out of business income. Thus the said purchase was a purchase for commercial purposes and L Ltd. was held not to be a consumer under the Act. One thing is plain and clear from the decided cases that what is important to decide is - Whether a particular good is used for commercial purposes. If it is the buyer/user is not a consumer, and if it is not - the buyer/user is a consumer.",

The Commission held that by no stretch of imagina­tion it can be said that the photocopier would bring large scale profits to A. It was a part of his small scale enterprise. He was construed as consumer under the Act. However, if such a buyer takes assistance of two or more persons to help him in operating the vehicle or machine, etc., he does not cease to be a consumer. Examples : 1. A buys a truck, ply it himself and hires a cleaner who accompany him all the time and at times drives also when A is busy otherwise, A is a consumer. 2. P, an eye surgeon, purchased a machine from R for the hospital run by him. The machine was found to be a defective one. R contended that P was not a consumer under the Act as the ma­chine was bought for commercial purposes. The National Commis­sion rejected this contention and held that P is a medical prac­titioner, a professional working by way of self employment by using his knowledge and skill to earn his livelihood. It was not proved by any evidence that P is running a huge hospital. Thus the purchase of machinery is in the nature of self employment. [Rampion Pharmaceuticals v.

Example : A contracted with B to supply, erect and commission cold rolling mill. A supplied the mill, but failed to erect and commission the mill. B filed a suit alleging deficiency of service on A’s failure to elect and commission the mill. The National Commission observed that the deficiency must pertain to performance of service. Since A never started erecting and com­missioning the mill, the question of performance did not arise. Thus the case is not that of deficiency of service - Jaipur Metals & Electricals Ltd. v. Laxmi Inds. [1991] II CPJ 602 (NC). (b) Such quality and manner of performance of service should have been required to be maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise. Example : A, the builder, promised under written agree­ment to provide a flat to B. Subsequently he expressed his inability to give possession of the flat and entered into a fresh agreement to pay Rs. 9,51,000 to B in place of flat. A didn’t even pay this money. B sued A. The Commission held that since A had not even paid the money as per subsequent contract, the rights of earlier contract can be involved by B. And that there was a deficiency of service on the part of builders - Lata Con­struction v. Dr. Rameshchandra Ramniklal Shah AIR 2000 SC 380 (384). (c) The deficiency must be in relation to a service - The words ‘....in relation to any service’ in the definition signifies that the deficiency is always in terms of service. Thus if the grievance pertains to a matter which does not fall in the definition of service, the concept of deficiency would not apply. Example : A deposited Rs. 100 with B as application fee and executed bond for the purpose of drilling tubewell. B did not drill the tubewell because it was not feasible. A alleged defi­ciency in service. It was held that depositing Rs. 100 as appli­cation fee and executing a bond does not amount to hiring of services, thus the deficiency of service cannot be complained of in the matter - Mangilal v. Chairman District Rural Development Agency [1991] 1 CPJ 474 (Raj.). Deficiency in service due to circumstances beyond control In normal course, if the service is found deficient as per the above criteria, it is held deficient and the compensation is awarded. However there may be abnormal circumstances beyond the control of the person performing service. If such circumstances prevent a person from rendering service of the desired quality, nature and the manner, such person should not be penalised for the same. Example : A undertook to supply water to B for irrigation of crops. Due to power grid failure of the State, A could not get sufficient power to perform the service. Here A cannot be held liable for deficiency in service. However, negligence on the part of performer may not be excused under the cover of circumstances beyond control.",

N bought H-4 Cotton seeds from the market which were labelled as produced and marketed by the Hindustan Levers Ltd. N established that the seeds were defective. He sued HLL. HLL contended that it did not manufactured the seeds but had only marketed them, and that some company based in Gujarat produced the same.

In our country, however, consumers do not get adequate comparative information about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of different kinds of goods or services which are available. As a result buying decisions become difficult. Therefore consumers need to be given maximum information about the wide variety of competing goods available in the market. Right to choose - The right to choose can be made meaningful by ensuring access to a variety of goods and services at competitive prices. Fair and effective competition must be encouraged so as to provide consumers with the widest range of products and services at the lowest cost. Right to represent - It is right to be heard and to be assured that consumer’s interests will receive due consideration at appropriate forums. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has well taken care of this right by making available the instrumentality of Redressal Forums. Every consumer has a right to file complaint and be heard in that context. Right to redressal - It is a right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive trade practices or unserpu­lous exploitation of consumers. When consumers are wronged in a market place transaction, appropriate and adequate redress must be available. The Act has ensured this right by establishing Consumer Forums and recognising restrictive and unfair trade practices as a ground to make a complaint. Right to education - The right to consumer education is a right which ensures that consumers are informed about the practices prevalent in the market and the remedies available to them. For spreading this education, media, or school curriculum, or cultural activities, etc. may be used as a medium. Note that the Central Council’s object is to ensure these rights of the consumers throughout the country while the State Councils look to ensure these rights to consumers within their territo­ries.

In addition, these rules have prescribed some procedures to be followed by the par­ties to the complaint. A complaint may be made with respect to the goods or services. When complaint relates to goods, the criteria for the decision is - whether the goods are defective or not. Now the question is - how to hold that the goods are defective. The most logical way is to get the goods tested to determine the defect. However, in certain cases defect can be determined without technical support or it may happen that the test is not feasible. These are— - The opposite party admits the defect. - The defect is obvious and is visible to naked eyes, like in a complaint about contamination of water, the sample of water given was so dirty that the Forum did not consider it necessary to send it for test. - When the complainant is not in possession of the sub­ject matter of the complaint, e.g., in a matter the complainant had given to the dealer the tyre and tube which had burst, the dealer sent the same to the manufacturer. Thus the complainant was not in possession of the same. - When subject matter of the complaint gets destroyed, like in case a pressure cooker burst, its remains can’t be send to the laboratory for testing. - In case of complaint regarding deficiency in service there is no question of testing or analysis. Thus the procedure to be followed by the Forums can be discussed under the two heads— 1. where laboratory test is required to determine the defect in goods. 2. where no laboratory test is required to determine the defect in goods or the complaint relates to services.",
